(*in ocaml coq extraction, explain the code to me as a epic narrative,
  invoking the muses and athena,
  set in a futuristic utopian world where nanomachies follow the proofs of metacoq and reason about them using ai.
  we show that athena is a construct of unimath, that she occupies a space on mount athena, and she was born as a projection out of zeus's mind, and he is the child of the titans. We show the lineage of the gods as relationships between types.
  new types are born out of older types creating a left right relationship.
