We can use fundamental types of Constructors and Record Types to describe the first layer of the asts.


** construct a new copy of the program in parts
*** header with includes
**** Open all needed fundamental types
***** Should come from existing opens collected in source module
***** Recursive processing of modules
*** for each type declaration
**** Process constructors with tuples of primitive types as args
***** Process lists and optionals still not working.
***** for each type mentioned in the constructor

****** Generate a call to process the fundamental type.
The constructors are called in order

******* Generate a declaration of the stub function to process the fundamental type
this allows for customization of processing.
**** Process record types with list of fields.
